# Project Title: Ch√© & Cherice Rebranded Website

## Overview

I am a podcast host, collaborating with my wife, and our podcast is dedicated to nurturing a welcoming environment for heartfelt conversations and providing genuine insights into the experiences of married millennials. In our pursuit of growth, I embarked on the journey of creating a fresh, rebranded website.

The previous iteration of our website faced significant challenges, including sluggish performance, lackluster SEO rankings, and an outdated visual design. To overcome these hurdles and provide an enhanced online experience for our audience, I undertook the development of a new website. This endeavor was driven by a tech stack that includes HTML, SCSS for sleek styling, 11ty as our static site generator, Nunjucks for versatile templating, and the efficient Decap CMS to effortlessly manage our blog content.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project were as follows:

- **Performance Improvement**: The original website experienced slow loading times, negatively impacting user experience. The new website aimed to provide a faster and more responsive browsing experience.

- **On Page SEO Optimization**: The previous website had poor On Page SEO optimization, resulting in low search engine visibility. The rebranded website focused on maximizing the website's visibility in search engine results, so I implemented comprehensive on-page SEO optimization strategies. This involved fine-tuning individual web pages to enhance their search engine rankings and overall discoverability. Elements such as meta tags, keyword placement, and content structure were meticulously optimized to ensure that each page is primed for optimal search engine performance.

- **Modern Design**: The outdated design of the original website did not resonate with our target audience. The new website sought to adopt a modern and visually appealing design that aligns better with our simple modern style.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were employed in the development of the website:

- **HTML**: HTML was used to structure the website's content, ensuring accessibility and compatibility across various devices and browsers.

- **SCSS (Sass)**: SCSS was utilized for stylesheet development, allowing for efficient CSS code management and maintainability.

- **11ty (Eleventy)**: 11ty served as the static site generator, enabling the conversion of templates and content into static HTML pages. This approach significantly improved website performance by eliminating the need for server-side rendering.

- **Nunjucks**: Nunjucks templating language was employed to create dynamic and reusable templates for consistent design elements throughout the website.

- **Decap CMS**: Decap CMS was integrated into the website to manage and publish blog content. This content management system simplified the process of creating and updating blog posts, enhancing the site's overall content strategy.

## Project Features

#### Call-to-Action (CTA) Component on Every Page

To encourage user interaction and engagement from brand represetatives, a CTA component was strategically placed on every page of the website except the main blog page. This component prompts visitors to not only learn more about who we are, but also take action by sending us an email with interest of collaborating with us on future brand deals.

#### Embedded Podcast Iframe from Buzzsprout

To provide a seamless podcast listening experience, I integrated an embedded podcast iframe sourced from Buzzsprout directly into the website. This iframe allows visitors to stream podcast episodes directly from the site, eliminating the need for external apps or platforms. This feature not only enhances user convenience but also keeps visitors engaged with the podcast content.

#### Decap CMS for Easy Blog Management

Managing and updating blog content is simplified through the integration of Decap CMS. This content management system allows me to effortlessly create, edit, and publish blog posts. The intuitive interface of Decap CMS ensures that the blog section remains dynamic and up-to-date, facilitating the continuous delivery of relevant content to our audience.

#### Lighthouse Status Report Achievements

One of the notable achievements of this project is the outstanding performance as evidenced by the Lighthouse status report. The website has consistently achieved a perfect score of 100 in four critical categories:

- **Performance (100)**: The website's exceptional performance ensures swift loading times and responsiveness, providing an optimal user experience.

- **Accessibility (100)**: Accessibility best practices have been rigorously implemented, making the website inclusive and user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.

- **Best Practices (100)**: The website adheres to industry best practices, ensuring a robust and secure online presence.

- **SEO (100)**: Comprehensive search engine optimization efforts have yielded a perfect SEO score, enhancing the website's visibility and discoverability on search engines.

These exceptional scores reflect my commitment to delivering a high-quality website that excels in terms of performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO optimization.
