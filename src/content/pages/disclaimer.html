      <h3>Effective Date: August 1, 2023</h3>
      <h4>1. Affiliate Disclosure:</h4>
        <p>
          The Ché & Cherice website may include affiliate links on certain pages
          or posts. An affiliate link means that we may earn a commission if you
          click on the link and make a purchase. The inclusion of affiliate
          links does not affect the price you pay for the product or service; it
          simply allows us to earn a small commission for referring you.
        </p>
        <h4>
