Who would've thought that a simple TikTok message could set off a rollercoaster ride that lasted a whole year? Yep, you read that right. We're here, 365 days later, celebrating not just one year of marriage bliss but also a whole bunch of other unexpected adventures that came our way!

If you've been rocking with us since the start of our YouTube escapades, you probably know the question that's been on everyone's lips: "**So, when's the big day?"** Seriously, it's like every comment and every DM on Instagram has been asking us that non-stop. But honestly, it's been kinda cool; we love that you all are as excited about our journey as we are. And when we finally spilled the beans about getting hitched, the amount of love we got from our online fam was mind-blowing.

Since the very beginning of our relationship, we've had this unshakable feeling that we're meant to be together. Let me take you back to a moment that still gives me goosebumps. A few weeks before flying to Houston to meet Ché, I heard Etta James' "At Last" playing on the radio. I suddenly felt this overwhelming rush of emotions, like my heart was doing cartwheels. I couldn't stop crying, and it was like the universe was telling me, "Yep, she's the one."

Our original plan was the whole long-distance dating thing. We'd take turns flying to see each other every month. But plans? Plans went out the window when we met in person for the first time. I flew to Houston for a visit and never left. I know, sounds crazy, right? But trust me, when you feel that spark, you just go with it!

Rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck, they say. But what about both of us testing positive for COVID just days before the wedding? Yep, that's what happened to us. I remember being in the emergency room, surrounded by medical staff, bawling my eyes out when we got the results. It wasn't even about the wedding at that point. I was just so ready to call Ché my wife. After all the ups and downs in past relationships, finding someone who made life feel so right, we were beyond eager to say our vows.

So, with a canceled flight, a scrapped honeymoon cruise, and a crazy 8-hour road trip to Dallas, we finally managed to tie the knot in front of our parents. My wife, I can't get enough of saying that. Marrying Ché has been the absolute highlight of my life, hands down, no contest.

I never expected marriage to change things emotionally, but boy, was I wrong. This might sound cheesy, but there's this whole new level of connection to Ché's soul. It's like I'm head over heels not just for her, but for every little thing that makes her who she is. It's overwhelming in the best way possible.

Let's not sugarcoat it, though. Marriage? It's a full-time gig, no doubt about it. But you know what? Even on the tough days, when we're both navigating uncharted territory, there's nothing quite like snuggling up in bed with Ché, seeing her smile, and knowing that we're in it together. It won't always be a fairytale, but we are ready to put in the effort to make sure our marriage thrives.

Ché and I had a pact from day one: our marriage, our way. We don't compare ourselves to anyone else, and we don't let anyone else's opinions, whether from family or friends, dictate our path. This is our journey, and we're steering the ship.

So, here's to us! Let's raise a toast to more love, to open and honest conversations, and to making those dollar bills!

Catch you later!
