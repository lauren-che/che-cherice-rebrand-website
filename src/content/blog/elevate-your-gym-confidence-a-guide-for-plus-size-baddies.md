Alright ladies lets be honest here, we have all had a mini panic attack when its time for us to go to the gym! Wondering if the person next to us is staring because we are overweight or because we think we look dumb trying out a machine we’ve never seen before in our life.

Going to the gym can be intimidating for anyone, but especially for us plus-size queens who may feel self-conscious about our bodies. In a day and age where social media influences everything from how to properly workout and even to how cute you should look while doing it.

When in all actuality the gym is a place for everyone to work on their health and fitness goals, regardless of size. With the right mindset we can build our confidence and enjoy our time at the gym.

Here are some tips for building confidence and feeling good as a plus-size queen at the gym:

- First and foremost ladies when you look good you feel good, so why not wear clothes that make you feel confident! The right workout clothes can do wonders for your confidence. Look for comfortable, supportive, and well-fitting clothes that make you feel good about your body. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different styles and colors to find what works best for you.

- The days of wearing super big t-shirts and baggy sweatpants are over, buy the cute fitness set and work it! We all have different body types so let go of the expectations of looking like the size 2 model. Your body is beautiful and when you feel good in your clothes, you’ll be more likely to feel good about yourself and have a positive gym experience.

- Setting realistic goals will give you a sense of purpose and motivation when working out. Focus on what you can do today, rather than comparing yourself to others or expecting overnight results. Remember that progress is not overnight, and that’s okay. Celebrate your achievements and keep pushing yourself to achieve more.

- Surround yourself with positive energy. Find a social media group with likeminded people or workout partner who supports and motivates you. My wife is my number one cheerleader in the gym and having positive and encouraging people around you can boost your confidence and help you feel more comfortable at the gym.
